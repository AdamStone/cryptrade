    Modified from matplotlib.finance module to change color of high-low lines.
    
    quotes is a sequence of (time, open, close, high, low, ...) sequences.
        As long as the first 5 elements are these values,
        the record can be as long as you want (eg it may store volume).
    
        time must be in float days format - see date2num
    
        Plots the time, open, close, high, low as a vertical line ranging
        from low to high.  Uses a rectangular bar to represent the
        open-close span.  If close >= open, uses colorup to color the bar,
        otherwise uses colordown.

    ax          : an Axes instance to plot to
    width       : fraction of a day for the rectangle width
    colorup     : the color of the rectangle where close >= open
    colordown   : the color of the rectangle where close <  open
    alpha       : the rectangle alpha level
    colorline   : the color of the high-low line; defaults to colorup/colordown

    return value is lines, patches where lines is a list of lines
    added and patches is a list of the rectangle patches added
