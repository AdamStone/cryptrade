    """ Base class for defining conditions at which trades should be executed. 
    Basically, it stores a function to be evaluated later (when check() is 
    called). Conditions can be added in order to create AND relationships and 
    subtracted to create AND NOT relationships. 
    
    A Condition is instantiated with a custom function to be evaluated later 
    when Condition.check() is called. Since trading strategies may involve
    many considerations (recent trades, current position, particular sets of 
    candles, even other Conditions...), the check() expects only **kwargs,
    which are passed directly to the stored function. As such, the function 
    should always accept **kwargs in addition to the specific args needed for 
    its own execution. 
    
    The ExchangeTrader in trading.py used by the live trading GUI currently
    passes position, my_trades, and candlestream kwargs in its update calls.
    
    AND and AND NOT relationships between Conditions are achieved using
    arithmetic operators, e.g. for conditions A and B,
        
        A + B yields a new Condition which represents A AND B
        A - B yields a new Condition which represents A AND NOT B
        
    A and B may expect different arguments, but when check() is called, 
    it should be passed keywords accounting for all the arguments expected 
    by either A and B.

    generally desirable. The purpose of this condition is to block buy
    signals when there is a recent stoploss and certain buyback conditions
    are not met. 
    
    There are two types of buyback criteria. 
    
        The first is the occurrence of at least one trend change since the 
        stoploss, e.g. the price drop eventually turned into a downtrend. 
        Any new buy signals after this would mean a new uptrend has begun, 
        so the stoploss should no longer be relevant. 
        
        The second is a price rebound. Consider the case where a stoploss 
        is triggered but the price rebounds before a downtrend begins, 
        such that the original uptrend continues and a trend change is never
        detected. The stoploss in this case was a 'false alarm,' so buyback 
        is reenabled if a price rebound persists for a given number of candles.
